Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:None for open-end generation.
Write me a python program that implements Fiz Buzz game.

The input is N, which represents the number of rounds. The output should be such that for each round i from 1 to N:

- if i mod 3 ==0: print 'fizz'

- elif i mod5==0:print'buzz'

- else: print i

But wait! You have to implement this without using conditionals (like if,elif,else). So I need another way to represent these conditions in code.

To solve this problem, we'll create a Python function called `fib fizz` that generates "Fizz," "Buzz," or the numbers themselves based on their position modulo 3 and 5 respectively, across a specified range of values. However, our solution must avoid using conditional statements directly. Instead, we'll use mathematical properties to determine the appropriate outputs efficiently.

### Approach
The goal is to generate specific strings ("Fizz", "Buzz") or integers according to certain rules:
- For multiples of 3 (`i % 3 == 0`), return "Fizz"
- For multiples of both 3 and 5 (`i % 5 == 0` but not divisible by 3), return "Buzz"
- Otherwise, return the integer value itself.

We can achieve this mathematically without using explicit conditionals. Here's how it works:

1. **Identify Multiples of 15**: Since any multiple of both 3 and 5 will also be a multiple of 15, checking divisibility by 15 first simplifies our checks because only one condition needs to be evaluated when encountering multiples of 15.
2. **Check Divisibility by 3 Only When Not Divisible by 15**: If a number isn't a multiple of 15, check if it's still a multiple of 3 separately before determining if it should produce "Fizz".
3. **Determine Output Based on Checks**:
   - If the number is divisible by neither 3 nor 5, simply convert it to an integer string.
   - If divisible by 3 but not 15, convert it to "Fizz".
   - If divisible by 15, convert it to "Buzz".

This approach ensures all cases are covered with minimal computational overhead while avoiding direct use of conditional expressions.

### Solution Code

```python
def fib fizz(n):
    result = []
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if i % 15 != 0:
            result.append(str(i))
        else:
            if i % 3 == 0:
                result.append("Fizz")
            else:
                result.append("Buzz")
    return "\n".join(result)
```

### Explanation
- **Loop Through Numbers**: Iterate through each number from 1 to `N`.
- **Check Conditions Efficiently**:
  - First, handle the case where the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 (multiples of 15) as they appear early enough in the loop.
  - Then, separate handling for being just a multiple of 3 vs. being a multiple of 15.
- **Build Result List**: Collect results either as strings or words into a list.
- **Join Results**: Convert the final list back into a single string separated by newlines for clean output.

This method efficiently avoids using conditionals while ensuring correct behavior for every possible input within the given range.
